> **A short description**:While doing this project, I had the idea of ​​integrating a daily rental car payment system and managing all of these from the admin panel. I set out by designing the plans and the course of events. It was very good in terms of convenience that we could manage all the activities on the page on the admin page. You can also provide the controls, the admin username and password are just above.

## 🎯 Features
- ✅ **Feature 1**: Users can easily filter and find cars based on their preferences, such as brand, model, and rental duration.
- ✅ **Feature 2**: Admins have full control over car listings, rental requests, and user management through a dedicated dashboard.
- ✅ **Feature 3**:  Users can book cars for daily or long-term rentals, schedule pickup times, and manage their reservations effortlessly.
